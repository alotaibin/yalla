# Subchallenge C2

* c2-1-simulate.R - This script simulates the training data. Note that it requires that you first run c1-1-fits.R with q0 set to 0.6 and n.boots set to 750. The full training data is quite big and the computations can be quite time consuming; with K = 350000 sets of training data, expect an Rdata file of approximately 60GB.
* c2-2-train.jl - This is a Julia for training the neural Bayes estimator and evaluating it on the data (as well as producing bootstrap estimates). Training is done using the [NeuralEstimators.jl](https://github.com/msainsburydale/NeuralEstimators.jl) package; please set the linked repo for details on installation. This code will not run on a standard laptop and requires a high-end GPU to run in a reasonable timeframe.
 * c2-3-plot.R  Plots the results and prints out bootstrap estimates.
