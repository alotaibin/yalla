# Yalla - EVA 2023 Data Challenge Winning Team

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the KAUST Extreme Statistics (extSTAT) Research Group's submissions for the Extreme Value Analysis (EVA) 2023 Data Challenge, held at Bocconi University in Milan, Italy. This repository contains all the R code, data analyses, and additional resources used by our team, the "Yalla Team," to secure first place in this prestigious international competition.

## About the EVA 2023 Data Challenge

The EVA 2023 Data Challenge presented participants with a series of complex problems centered around the analysis of environmental extreme data. Organized by esteemed academics from the University of Bath, University College London, and Lancaster University, the challenge involved four sub-challenges that required innovative statistical approaches to model extreme quantiles and estimate tail probabilities in various dimensional settings.

## Our Team's Achievement

Our team, comprising a dynamic group of researchers and Ph.D. students from KAUST, excelled in the competition by developing new methodologies that effectively addressed each sub-challenges. We achieved a second-place finish in three of the four sub-challenges and clinched the best performance in the final sub-challenge, leading to our overall win.

## Repository Contents

- R Scripts: Contains all the R code files used for data analysis in the competition. Each script is associated with one of the four sub-challenges.

- Data: Includes the simulated datasets provided during the competition and any additional data generated by our analyses.

- Documentation: Offers detailed documentation of methodologies, code descriptions, and results for each sub-challenge.

## Usage

Researchers and students can explore the repository to understand our approaches to solving extreme value problems, replicate our analyses, or build upon our methodologies for related research.
